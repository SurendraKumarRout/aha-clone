## About Us:

For the 5th unit of our curriculum at Masai School, we learned about React,Redux, Styled Components and various other liabraries.

As the application part, We got chance to apply all our learnings from that unit and built something as intresting and challenging as this website(Aha Video). We are a team of four took six days to clone this website. As there is no way to show the whole movie or tv shows, our end goal was to play the trailer for the selected content.

## About Aha-Video:
